            <h2>Why are there only two images?</h2>
            <p>
                This computer science class that the user "kevinw0w" is taking has a requirement that each page must
                have at least 2 images, and this page is no exception. It also has a requirement that there must be at
                least 3 pages. So, that's what this is for. Two big images of Ukinami Yuzuha :3

    A dynamic anime-style image features Ukinami Yuzuha in her swimsuit outfit, seen from the side, facing right. She has long, vibrant red hair cascading down her back from a high ponytail. Her pink swimsuit has white and yellow accents, and a single white toy gun is attached to her hip. She holds a staff connected to a large, glowing blue, crystalline umbrella, which emits a bright light to the right. The background is blurred, emphasizing the action.' />

    An anime-style image shows Ukinami Yuzuha, a character with long, wavy red hair, standing on a tiled sidewalk in front of a building. She wears a pink and white sweater, a short red and white striped skirt, and dark boots with striped socks. She is holding a brown, elongated object that resembles a musical instrument case or a large bag, with a racoon-like creature perched on top of it. The building features large glass windows reflecting warm interior lights, and a dark red door with white trim. The scene is illuminated by the warm, golden light of a street light, casting shadows on the ground.' />
